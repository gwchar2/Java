# Java Applications: Four in a Row & Paint

## Four in a Row

### Overview
The **Four in a Row** game, also known as **Connect Four**, is a two-player strategy game where players take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a vertically suspended grid. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four consecutive discs.

### How to Play
1. **Grid Layout**: The game is played on a 7-column by 6-row grid.
2. **Turns**: Players take alternate turns. One player uses red discs, and the other uses yellow discs.
3. **Dropping Discs**: On each turn, a player selects a column to drop their disc into. The disc falls straight down to the lowest available slot within the selected column.
4. **Winning**: The first player to connect four of their discs in a row—vertically, horizontally, or diagonally—wins the game.
5. **Draw**: If the grid is completely filled without any player forming a line of four discs, the game ends in a draw.
6. **Reset**: After a game ends, players can reset the grid to start a new game.

### Features
- **Interactive UI**: Users can click on any column to drop their discs.
- **Winning Detection**: The game automatically checks for a winning condition after every move.
